        <h2>Aliens (1986)</h2>

        <p>Aliens is my all-time favorite movie. There are no boring scenes in this movie. The character development is excellent and it makes the viewer actually care about what happens to each character throughout the film. I also love that there is a strong female lead throughout this series.</p>

        <h2>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h2>

        <p>I think this is one of the most perfect movies ever made. I was not looking at my watch waiting for the movie to be over. I don't feel like this movie was excessively long or drawn out. The acting was great, the story was great, and this movie is very deserving to be #1 on the IMDB Top 250 Movies list. </p>
